  ## Improvemt Scope
  Accuracy of OCR can be improved to have better User Experience.
  Current Version only executes Python program, So More progaramming languages can be added.
  All the generated pdf is stored on local storage. Further it can be stored on Firebase database so user can see all the generated PDFs.
